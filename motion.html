				<h1>Brand Logo</h1>

				<p>This was simultaneously the most intensive and fun project which I am the most proud of. I decided to bring my Illustrator logo to life by having the blank record roll in from the right and having the text morph throughout the stage. I paired a subtle, groovy house track that furthered the animation's ambiance. The background image I altered on Photoshop to create a more flattering color palette. My ultimate inspiration was dreaming of an ad that might immediately entice me to visit a new alternative bar and I believe I accomplished just that.
