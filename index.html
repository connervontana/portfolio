				<h1>About Me</h1>

				<p>Welcome! 
                    My name is Conner and I've been living in San Francisco for over a year now. As I've been contemplating my next step in life, whether that be graduate school or a new job, it's been clear that learning the foundations of graphic design are going to be essential. Already I feel far more confident using my computer and have found a new creative outlet. I intend to continue taking Visual Media Design classes for fun and to keep building my portfolio. I am so excited to continue learning. 
                    
                    Enjoy.
</p>
