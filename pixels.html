				<h1>Self Portrait</h1>

				<p>For the photoshop project I was a little stumped by the idea of incorporating a selfie. I created this around Valentine's Day and, voila, there was my inspiration. I decided to go for a cheesy riff on a valentine gram meme but that still felt too one dimensional. I took it a step further by layering a frosting textured background, adding little frosted flowers which I clipped from an image of an actual cake, and then placed the artboard on a sheet cake mockup. I am not totally satisfied with the frame I created and would love to learn more about generating/using frames.
